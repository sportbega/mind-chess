# Mind Chess — Devlog

Lightweight milestone log, not a full diary. One entry per session/decision, appended — not rewritten.

## 2026-08-18 — Day 1: promoted to a real project

- Three prior artifact prototypes existed in `~/Downloads` (`mind-chess.html`, `_1`, `_2`). Promoted the latest (`_2`) into `~/mind-chess/index.html`, git-initialized.
- Created the Linear project "Mind Chess" (team OUR), status In Progress.
- Opened OUR-39 (smarter computer opponent) and OUR-40 (persist game state across reloads) as the two known gaps from the prototype phase.

## 2026-08-18 — Reviewed Giga Chess for reusable patterns

Read through `~/Documents/ChatGPT/chess project/chess.html` (Giga Chess — the sibling public chess project, Codex-managed workspace) since Mind Chess's board CSS was already derived from it. Findings:

- Giga Chess has a working alpha-beta minimax (`search()`) over a material + pawn-advancement eval (`value()`), exposed as 3 depth levels (Casual/Club/Sharp). Directly reusable for OUR-39.
- Giga Chess does **not** persist mid-game state across reloads either (only theme/radio preferences) — no shortcut available for OUR-40, that one needs to be built from scratch.
- Giga Chess's board/piece theme system (`data-board`/`data-pieces` CSS + localStorage) is a near copy-paste fit given the shared CSS variable names.
- Giga Chess has a proven Supabase realtime multiplayer pattern (anon auth, `chess_games` table, invite links) — noted as a future option, not scoped.
- Giga Chess has move/capture sound effects with a synthesized WebAudio fallback — noted as a cheap, isolated addition.

Decisions:
- Opened OUR-41 (board/piece theming) and OUR-42 (move/capture sound effects).
- Parked clock support (5) — blindfold play changes meaningfully under time pressure, worth a deliberate call later, not a default port.
- Parked multiplayer (6) — good future direction, not now.
- Kept Mind Chess standalone at `~/mind-chess` rather than folding it into the Codex-managed `chess project` workspace (different tooling/agent, already working as-is).

## 2026-08-18 — OUR-39: alpha-beta computer opponent

Replaced the random/greedy `computerMove()` with alpha-beta minimax (`searchScore()`) over a material + pawn-advancement `evaluate()`, ported from Giga Chess's algorithm onto chess.js. Added a Level select (Casual/Club/Sharp → search depth 1/2/3) next to the Opponent select.

Verified in-browser at all three depths: legal, sensible replies (e.g. `1. e4 Nc6 2. Nf3 Nb4`), no lag even at Sharp/depth 3, no console errors. Closed OUR-39.

## 2026-08-18 — OUR-40, OUR-41, OUR-42: persistence, theming, sound

Three more in one sitting, all built and verified before closing:

- **OUR-41 (theming):** ported Giga Chess's `data-board`/`data-pieces` CSS system, translated onto Mind Chess's own variable names (`--sq-light/dark` vs Giga's `--light/dark`, etc). Added Board/Pieces selects, persisted to localStorage. Verified: switched to Midnight board + Gold pieces, confirmed the board actually re-rendered with the new colors and survived a reload.
- **OUR-42 (sound):** ported `sound()`/`woodFallback()` from Giga Chess unchanged in approach — hosted click/thud sample, synthesized WebAudio fallback if it fails to load. Wired into `applyMove()` ahead of the narration call.
- **OUR-40 (persistence):** no existing pattern in Giga Chess to copy (it only persists preferences, not game state), so built from scratch: `game.pgn()` → localStorage on every `renderAll()`/`setBoardHidden()`/settings change, restored via `game.load_pgn()` on boot with a "Game restored" message in place of "New game." Verified: played `1. e4 Nc6`, reloaded, move strip and turn state came back intact.

All three closed. Gotcha worth remembering: `index.html` writes a couple of apostrophes as a JS unicode escape sequence in the source rather than as the literal character — a find/replace edit that pastes in the rendered apostrophe glyph will silently fail to match. Isolate the surrounding line into its own edit rather than fighting the escape.

## 2026-08-18 — Day 1 wrap

Closing the session here — clean stopping point, not a forced cutoff: all 4 issues opened today (OUR-39 through OUR-42) are closed, working tree is clean (`git status` empty), nothing mid-implementation.

Day 1 summary: three artifact prototypes → a real git-tracked project → Linear-tracked → a real search-based opponent, theming, sound, and reload persistence, all ported/adapted from Giga Chess where a pattern already existed there, built fresh where it didn't (persistence had no Giga precedent).

State for next session: nothing open in Linear for Mind Chess. Parked, not forgotten: clock (deliberately undecided), multiplayer (viable later via Giga's Supabase pattern, not scoped). Otherwise open-ended — next session picks a direction fresh.
